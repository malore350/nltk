# Text Summarization of Research Papers with Python
## Introduction
This repo serves the purpose of summarizing texts, and contains two models for that: K-means clustering and BART. It had been trained on papers from arXiv, specifically on the files from Computer Vision category.
One can run a demo to interactively utilize it. The tutorial for deploying and using it is given in the next article.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo to your favourite destination
2. Download weights for BART model from the following link, and add to the './nltk/model/' folder: https://mega.nz/file/tlQkyIwT#9f17-IRJ8ZsErBTzBMiigSzSVco9m0MG5UwDJxdi6uk
3. Either run the 'demo test.py' file, or run the following snippet in your terminal: `python demofile.py`.
4. Connect to the generated address.
